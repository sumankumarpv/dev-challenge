# dev-challenge
This is a Spring Boot RESTful application which can serve the following Account operations:

Creating a new account
Reading an account
Fetching all the accounts
Making a transfer between two accounts
How to run
Build the project using gradle. From project root:

./gradlew clean build
Once the project is built, you can run the jar as follows:

java -jar build/libs/Java\ dev-challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Example request:

curl -i -X PUT \
   -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
   -d \
'{
  "accountFromId":"Id-1",
  "accountToId":"Id-2",
  "amount": "1.55"
}' \
 'http://localhost:8081/v1/accounts/transfer'
Assumptions
You cannot make a transfer to the same account ID. In other words, you cannot send money to yourself.
When making a transfer the amount is in pounds / dollars not in pence / cents. For example, 100.45.
We can not transfer the amount which is greater than daili limit.
Further improvements
In RESTful services, it is not unusual to see the same request coming twice. In a production system we should handle those hiccups. One idea would be to perform a 2-step transfer. In the first step we create a transaction ID and then we request a transfer given this transaction ID. Once a transfer is made the transaction ID cannot be used anymore.
Instead of having a concurrent hashmap, in production we could have a database for storing the accounts as well as for scalability.
Another advantage of using a database is that we can handle transactional atomic account updates. We must have both accounts successfully updated or none.
I assumed that an amount can be transferred regardless of the number of decimal places the amount has. Ideally, there should be some business logic around handling requests with more than 2 decimal places (for example 100.254). That would probably be a Bad Request. A simpler approach could only take pence/cents as monetary amount, but to be consistent with Create/Read Account I used the decimal amount.
